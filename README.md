Swarm Keeper
=====================

This component allows users to write code that executed by a collection of
node objects instead of just one. Swarms can run on just one machine or can be
distributed over networks.

This library defines the common classes for different keeper implementations.
Please refer to components such as 
[node-swarmkeeper-http](http://github.com/jolira/node-swarmkeeper-http) for a
concrete implementation.
